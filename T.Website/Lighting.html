        <h2>Lighting Needs</h2>
       </div>

<p>Most plants need some type of light. Aquatic plants are no different. Some varieties need more or less of the different types of light, which are; red wavelength, blue wavelength, white wavelength, and green wavelength. All of these types offer different benefits to the plants and their overall growth and health.</p>
<p>Red light offers......</p>
<p>Blue wavelength lighting provides.....</p>
<p>Green and white wave lighting will help your plants.....</p>
<h2>Lighting Intensity</h2>
<p>You will want to be very careful with how much light your plants are getting in relation to their needs and growth rate. If your low-light plant gets too much light, either because the light is too strong, or because it is on for too long, your plant can be overrun with algea or even sunburned. (Yes, you can sunburn your plants!) The right amount f light will take a lot of time and patience on your part. Adjustments and corrections can be made to help give your plants the range they flourish best in.</p>
<h2>Lighting Choice & Caution</h2>
<P>You can choose a variety of different kinds of lights, but there are some general things you will want to consider. It is best to get an aquarium light that provides a wide range of the different types of color, and can be dimmed, as well as timed or has an automatic shut off. All of these factors can help you find the "sweet-spot" for your plants to get the most out of your light. </P>
<p> Be aware that plants take time to grow! If you make an adjustment, wait long enough for the plant to catch up and start showing the effects of your change. Patience is key. </P>
    <p>Remember that some plants will do great in one type and intensity of light, while another may have a few struggles with it. Do you research before you make purchases so you dont feel like you have wasted your time and energy on something you are supposed to enjoy!</p>
