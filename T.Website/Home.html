<p>Aquascaping is both beauitiful and rewarding. There is a lot of trial and error, but in the end you have a miniature world you created!</p>
<p>The first thing you will need when considering your own patch of living art, is light. The right lightng is very important for your plants, and any other living creatures you decide to add to your biome. </p>
<p>The second factor to consider would be substrate. Substrate is the type of soil, sand, or rocks you use at the bottom of your terrarium to anchor the plants or objects you choose to the bottom. This can be a very tricky choice, as it will directly affect the type of plants you can use in your aquascape.</p>
<p>The third necessity for a healthy and lush set-up would be your micro and macro nutrients. Check out our other pages to learn more about the type of products you can use as additives in your tank to keep it alive and healthy.</p>
