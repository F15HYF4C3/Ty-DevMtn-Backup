<h2>Soil</h2>
</div>
<p>You can use regular garden soil, but make sure it is organic or does not contain "perlite." Perlite can destroy the PH in your tank and poison any fish you hope to keep with your plants. You will also want to allow the soil to soak up water and add more slowly so as not to disturb and spread it around. You may still need to let it settle before adding plants or fish to your awaurium.</p>
<h2>Sand</h2>
<p>Sand is a great anchor, but most types of sand do not offer a lot of nutrients to your plants. It is a commonly used substrate with additives of fertilizer drops because of its beauty and natural look. It is also great for fresh or salt water fish who like to "sift" debri and waste as their main source of food.</p>
<h2>Rocks & Gravel</h2>
<p>When choosing these types, you will need to be mindful of bottom-feeding fish. They sometimes can swallow small gravel pieces mistaking them for food. Otherwise, these are grate options for holding your plants to the bottom, while also allowing for easier cleaning of your tank during water changes.</p>
<h2>Pre-made</h2>
<p>Commerically produced substrate has many benefits and drawbacks. There are lots of companies out there who have wonderfully made products, and others who value quantity over quality. Just be sure to read up on their ingredients and check reviews from other customers who have used these.
<h3>Replacement & Supplement</h3>
<p>Be aware that all nutrient-rich substrates will eventually become less affective over time. This is because your plants and fish are using the nutrients it provided. Actually having fish in your aquarium can help reduce this effect somewhat, since plants can use their waste and convert it to food. You can also prolong the life of your substrate by supplementing your aqaurium with liquid fertilizer however, you will eventually want to replace your substrate with new product to keep your plants happily fed. </p>
